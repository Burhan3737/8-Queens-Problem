# 8-Queens-Problem
 The famous 8 Queens problem solved using genetic algorithms.
 
 ## Working of the Algorithm

 ### 1-Fitness Fucntion
  -The fitness of a specific population is found by finding the number of non-attacking pairs.The goal is to reach the maximum fitness, which in the 8 queens problem is    28.
  ### 2-Roulette Wheel
  -The roulette wheel method is used to find out the 2 parents of the next generation.
  ### 3-Crossover
  -Random crossover point is chosen to be applied on both parents to produce 2 children.
  ### 4-Mutation
  -Mutation is applied on the new generation by choosing one single random gene to be mutated in the 2 new individuals.
  
Steps 2 to 4 are repeated until the required fitness is achieved.
